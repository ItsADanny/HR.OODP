Learning goals:

* if; else; else if
* ternary operator (optional)

Write a program that asks for your age, and then that of someone else (say, your neighbor student). 
Then print whether you are of the same age. You can optionally use the ternary operator. 
See Example 2-56 of the book.

Example 1:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is your age?
>20
What is the age of the student next to you?
>20
Your ages are equal
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example 2:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is your age?
>20
What is the age of the student next to you?
>19
You are older
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example 3:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is your age?
>19
What is the age of the student next to you?
>21
You are younger
