The assignment is a teaser for next week's Mini Project. 
It consists of multiple cs files, but you will only need to work in Program.cs.
The challenge in this assignment is that you will need to work with objects, 
which you haven't yet seen in this course, but you have worked with in Python.

The above is no longer true. Sorry for being rubbish. :)

See Program.cs for specific instructions on what to do.
