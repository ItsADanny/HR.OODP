Learning goals:

* switch statements

Write a program which asks for a direction, either up, down, right or left (case should not matter). Use a switch statement in your solution.

Given an X and Y position which start at x = 0 and y = 0, if the user enters:

* Up -> increase y by 1
* Down -> reduce y by 1
* Right -> increase x by 1
* Left -> decrease x by 1
  If any other value is given, print "Invalid direction", otherwise print the current x and y values.

Example 1:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
What direction would you like to go?
Up
Down
Right
Left
>up
Current position
X:0, Y:1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example 2:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
What direction would you like to go?
Up
Down
Right
Left
>spin
Invalid direction
Current position
X:0, Y:0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
