Learning goals:

* List indices
* Main

Running this program will result in an ArgumentOutOfRangeException due to a mistake in the code pack[pack.Count] on the last line. 
Fix the mistake so that the last element of pack (pen) is read correctly.

Also notice that this program is inside a method named Main, which is inside class Program. 
If a static void Main exists in a program, it will be the entry point, i.e. the program will start there.
