Make a List with the following grades: 6.5, 9.5, 4, 5, 4.5, 10, 7.1. Loop through them, and for grades lower than 5.5, ask the user if they want to retake this course (y/n). If they answer anything other than y or n (disregarding uppercase or lowercase), keep repeating the question.

Any course the user wishes to retake is increased by 1. Print the final list of grades.

For example:

Grade: 6.5
Grade: 9.5
Grade: 4
Retake this course? y/n
y
Grade: 5
Retake this course? y/n
n
Grade: 4.5

Grade: 10

Final grades:
